## Hints for higher marks

All the building blocks you need for the assignment are in this directory. Some hints for higher marks include the following:

- You could automatically detect which [zoom](plot.js#L697) should be used by Google Maps;
- Find a way to automatically clean your data (your phone’s GPS sensor isn’t that great, especially in cities);
- Most of all: do something “creative” and “interesting”! :grinning:
